# TargetDataBreach
Our project proposes a secure AWS architecture to prevent breaches like the 2013 Target data breach. It includes network isolation (VPCs), multi-factor authentication (IAM MFA), threat detection (GuardDuty, WAF), and secure data management (RDS, KMS, CloudTrail) to enhance security, scalability, and compliance.
